  Twiggzy will continue to commit itself to protecting and maximizing our users' privacy.
  We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised
  Privacy Policy in the "Privacy Policy" section of the Website, it is the responsibility
  of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy periodically to
  learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy is effective
  immediately when posted on the Website. Your continued use of the
  Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment
  and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b><br />
  We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable
  Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Personally Identifiable Information is information
  that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website,
  such as creating an account, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us feedback,
  requesting information about our services, or applying for a job through the
  Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain
  information about yourself.  It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity.
  If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us
  with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing
  address, email address, telephone number and date of birth. Depending on the activity,
  some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is
  identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular
  activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.
  <br /><br />
  We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, enhance 
  the operation of the Website, administer contests, improve our marketing and promotional
  efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your
  experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. In addition,
  if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your
  personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that other
  person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow
  the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use Personally
  Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks,
  contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this
  Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information is
  information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include
  things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming
  to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of
  browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized
  Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information
  when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons
  or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.
  <br /><br />
  We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, 
  analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate
  with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third
  Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online
  advertising, content, and programming.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Release of Personally Identifiable Information</b><br />
  We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as
  provided below:
<ul>
  <li>
    We may share your information with Twiggzy Merchants. From time to time, we provide offers
    from particular merchants (referred to as “Twiggzy Merchants”) who, as part of the offer,
    request information on Twiggzy customers (the "Shoppers")  who claimed the offer. In those
    cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with Twiggzy Merchants.
    Sharing this Information will allow a Twiggzy Merchant to market directly to you should
    they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information
    with a Twiggzy Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the
    Twiggzy Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. Please note that we will only
    provide a Twiggzy Merchant your information with an opt-in notice to you, in which you
    will have a chance to choose that Twiggzy not give the Twiggzy Merchant your personal
    information. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of
    such Twiggzy Merchants. While we inform them (the "Twiggzy Merchants") that they are only
    permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotions or deals
    with Twiggzy, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Twiggzy Merchant,
    and the actions of the Twiggzy Merchant are not in our control.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide
    some of our services and products through third parties. These "Third Party Service
    Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our
    administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable
    Information with such Service Providers to send postal or email, remove repetitive
    information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search
    results and links, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service.
    We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates")
    with whom we have business relationships and may have to also share their information with
    Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We encourage Third Party Service
    Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally
    Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such
    parties and is not subject to our control.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, 
    we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor
    company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable
    Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this
    Privacy Policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. 
    We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is
    appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy,
    our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of
    the Website, its Users or others.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br />
  We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates
  and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
  (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party
  Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided below:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
    These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to
    this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags,
    advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally
    Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
    our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
    for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers.
    Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of
    the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by
    us.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Updating and Correcting Information</b><br />
  We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
  Information you provide us. We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable
  Information if it changes. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete all
  of your information because we periodically backup information.
</p>
<p>
  <b>User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</b><br />
  As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be
  required to engage in a certain activity on the Website. As a condition of purchase of our
  products and services, we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will
  send you information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about
  our products and promotional offers.
  <br />
  You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User's
  activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User's account and
  requests or inquiries. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice
  with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and services,
  and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. Contact us if you no
  longer want to receive by emailing us and please indicate your fullname and email address.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Security of Information</b><br />
  We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of
  Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information
  on our Website through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted.
  We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. Any Personally Identifiable
  Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have
  access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
  technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is
  transmitted to us.
  <br />
  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be
  guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
  security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same,
  we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website,
  and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such
  information.

<p>
  <b>Data Tracking</b><br />
  <strong>Cookies.</strong> To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website,
  we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's
  computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User.
  We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track
  and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us
  to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited
  and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more
  user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising
  Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place
  separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
  This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the
  use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be
  able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or
  delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We may use other industry standard technologies
  like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or
  we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf.
  Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website,
  or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action.
  When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a
  Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and
  improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us
  a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web
  beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.
